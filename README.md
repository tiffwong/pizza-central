# Pizza Central
Created by Tiffany Wong

The goal of this project is to combine the apps and extensions that are used daily into one web application in order to minimize the amount of time switching between tabs or even windows. Included in the project is the date and time, a music player (Spotify), an agenda (Google Calendar) and a to do list. On the top of the web application is a horizontal bar that contains commonly used links.

The idea is to have the web application hosted on a personal server and set it to one of the default websites loaded when the browser is initially launched.

To run the code, execute `index.html`.
