Project for CS 338: Graphical User Interfaces

Pizza Central isn’t about pizza. However, I did want the name to convey the idea of having all your favorite components or “toppings” in one place.

The goal of this project is to combine the apps and extensions that are used daily into one web application in order to minimize the amount of time switching between tabs or even windows. Included in the project is the date and time, a music player (Spotify), an agenda (Google Calendar) and a to do list. On the top of the web application is a horizontal bar that contains commonly used links.

The idea is to have the web application hosted on a personal server and set it to one of the default websites loaded when the browser is initially launched.

To run the code, execute `index.html`.

### NOTE
:pizza: Songs in music player only play for a few seconds
<br />
:pizza: Calendars in agenda must be set to public in order to be displayed

### TODO
- [ ] Remove links to embed content
- [ ] Remove bottom padding from music player and agenda
- [ ] Find alternate music player
